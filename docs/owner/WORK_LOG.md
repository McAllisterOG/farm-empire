# Farm Empire Work Log

Record major completed packages and stable checkpoints here. Keep day-to-day chat and minor edits out.

## Farming Business V1 - complete

- **Date:** 2026-08-09
- **Branch:** `codex/farming-business-v1`
- **Commits:** `ce100df`, `7a520ba`, `e29464b`, `75e5024`
- **Result:** Implemented the complete seed-to-expansion farming-business loop with four crops, finite barn storage, deterministic commodity prices and temporary events, selling and reinvestment, a purchasable neighboring parcel, structured old-tractor benefits, focused Farm Empire UI, and save schema v4.
- **Verification:** 88/88 tests passed; strict typecheck passed; production build passed; fresh-save browser acceptance and save/reload passed; clean browser reload had zero console errors.
- **Push:** `origin/codex/farming-business-v1`
- **Known limitations:** Compact inherited island terrain, straight-line movement, abstract non-drivable tractor, and deferred equipment/logistics/business depth.

## Owner Console infrastructure - complete

- **Date:** 2026-08-09
- **Branch:** `codex/farming-business-v1`
- **Scope:** Documentation and coordination workflow only; no gameplay code or Milestone 2 work.
- **Result:** Added durable game-vision, recovery, discussion, Brainstorm Mode, authorization, bounded worker, Red Team, decision-record, work-log, and checkpoint-maintenance documentation.
- **Verification:** Documentation read-back, Git diff review, and whitespace validation.

## Operated tractor field work - complete

- **Date:** 2026-08-10
- **Branch:** `codex/tractor-field-work`
- **Commits:** `fd1dcd0`, `0690cda`
- **Scope:** Operated old tractor, click-to-drive movement, and sequential batch planting/harvesting across one owned 3×3 parcel at a time; no advanced vehicle or logistics systems.
- **Result:** Added deterministic serpentine parcel planning, mounted presentation, live job progress, safe partial outcomes and cancellation, persisted tractor position, and safe dismount behavior after mounted saves while preserving the on-foot loop.
- **Verification:** 93/93 tests passed; strict typecheck passed; production build passed; primary and Owner Console browser acceptance passed; console had zero warnings/errors.
- **Review:** Independent Red Team found no CRITICAL/HIGH issues, identified one mounted-save MEDIUM defect, and accepted the milestone after one repair/re-review cycle with no remaining MEDIUM findings.
- **Screenshot:** `docs/screenshots/tractor-field-work.png`
- **Known limitations:** Straight-line movement has no pathfinding/collision physics; Equipment panel state may remain stale during standalone driving until reopened; retained input-listener cleanup is a deferred LOW lifecycle concern.
- **Push:** Not yet pushed; external GitHub authorization is still required.
