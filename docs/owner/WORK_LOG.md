# Farm Empire Work Log

Record major completed packages and stable checkpoints here. Keep day-to-day chat and minor edits out.

## Farming Business V1 - complete

- **Date:** 2026-08-09
- **Branch:** `codex/farming-business-v1`
- **Commits:** `ce100df`, `7a520ba`, `e29464b`, `75e5024`
- **Result:** Implemented the complete seed-to-expansion farming-business loop with four crops, finite barn storage, deterministic commodity prices and temporary events, selling and reinvestment, a purchasable neighboring parcel, structured old-tractor benefits, focused Farm Empire UI, and save schema v4.
- **Verification:** 88/88 tests passed; strict typecheck passed; production build passed; fresh-save browser acceptance and save/reload passed; clean browser reload had zero console errors.
- **Push:** `origin/codex/farming-business-v1`
- **Known limitations:** Compact inherited island terrain, straight-line movement, abstract non-drivable tractor, and deferred equipment/logistics/business depth.

## Owner Console infrastructure - complete

- **Date:** 2026-08-09
- **Branch:** `codex/farming-business-v1`
- **Scope:** Documentation and coordination workflow only; no gameplay code or Milestone 2 work.
- **Result:** Added durable game-vision, recovery, discussion, Brainstorm Mode, authorization, bounded worker, Red Team, decision-record, work-log, and checkpoint-maintenance documentation.
- **Verification:** Documentation read-back, Git diff review, and whitespace validation.

## Operated tractor field work - complete

- **Date:** 2026-08-10
- **Branch:** `codex/tractor-field-work`
- **Commits:** `fd1dcd0`, `0690cda`
- **Scope:** Operated old tractor, click-to-drive movement, and sequential batch planting/harvesting across one owned 3×3 parcel at a time; no advanced vehicle or logistics systems.
- **Result:** Added deterministic serpentine parcel planning, mounted presentation, live job progress, safe partial outcomes and cancellation, persisted tractor position, and safe dismount behavior after mounted saves while preserving the on-foot loop.
- **Verification:** 93/93 tests passed; strict typecheck passed; production build passed; primary and Owner Console browser acceptance passed; console had zero warnings/errors.
- **Review:** Independent Red Team found no CRITICAL/HIGH issues, identified one mounted-save MEDIUM defect, and accepted the milestone after one repair/re-review cycle with no remaining MEDIUM findings.
- **Screenshot:** `docs/screenshots/tractor-field-work.png`
- **Known limitations:** Straight-line movement has no pathfinding/collision physics; Equipment panel state may remain stale during standalone driving until reopened; retained input-listener cleanup is a deferred LOW lifecycle concern.
- **Push:** Not yet pushed; external GitHub authorization is still required.

## Farm Scale & Terrain Overhaul - complete

- **Date:** 2026-08-10
- **Branch:** `codex/farm-scale-overhaul`
- **Commits:** `4286383`, `4cf6d00`, `fedeff2`
- **Scope:** Save-compatible presentation projection, large field sections, 3x3 parcel-scale land, flat mainland terrain, rural framing, denser crop rows, and stronger barn/tractor silhouettes; no economy, simulation, or save-schema changes.
- **Result:** Replaced the compact inherited island view with a substantially larger working farm while preserving logical plot coordinates, input behavior, land ownership, tractor jobs, and old saves.
- **Verification:** 98/98 tests passed; strict typecheck passed; production build passed; fresh and expanded farm browser acceptance, crop interaction and harvest, land purchase, tractor entry, mounted save/reload, and clean console verified.
- **Review:** Independent Red Team found no MEDIUM-or-higher issues and accepted the milestone after one bounded cleanup of legacy path diamonds, grass variation, terminology, and footprint regression coverage.
- **Screenshots:** `docs/screenshots/farm-scale-starter-crops.png`, `docs/screenshots/farm-scale-expanded-property.png`
- **Known limitations:** The farmer and farm focal objects remain small relative to the new field scale; the next bounded package addresses farmyard identity and life.
- **Push:** Not yet pushed; external GitHub authorization is still required.

## Farmyard Identity Slice - complete

- **Date:** 2026-08-10
- **Branch:** `codex/farmyard-identity`
- **Commits:** `714da7c`, `89f636d`, `3481ea4`, `004e2e3`, `720eddb`, `eb10f20`, `c770732`
- **Scope:** Larger animated farm-only farmer; transient Scout follow/home/sit/scratches behavior; detailed farm-only barn, tractor, and doghouse art; no save, economy, quest, adoption, or legacy-system changes.
- **Result:** Added a visibly larger four-facing rural farmer, an expressive farm dog who follows on foot and rests during tractor work, reliable near/far scratches with visible heart feedback, and farmyard focal objects scaled to the enlarged property.
- **Verification:** 104/104 tests passed; strict typecheck and production build passed; browser acceptance covered movement/facing, Scout follow and held far approach, scratch feedback, tractor home travel/sit/exit resume, barn/tractor/field interactions, alternate-click cancellation, save/reload, and a console with zero warnings/errors.
- **Review:** Independent Red Team accepted after the bounded repair/re-review closed teleport, depth sorting, missing focal-art, delayed-menu, and travel-pose findings; no MEDIUM-or-higher issues remain.
- **Screenshots:** `docs/screenshots/farmyard-identity-on-foot.png`, `docs/screenshots/farmyard-identity-tractor.png`
- **Known limitations:** Scout has no persisted bonding/economy system by design; the large open yard still needs more non-interactive rural set dressing and ambient motion.
- **Push:** Not yet pushed; external GitHub authorization is still required.
